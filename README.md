# Student Course Management System

## Project Description
The Student Course Management System (SCMS) is a JavaFX-based application designed to streamline academic record management in educational institutions. It enables administrators to efficiently manage students, courses, instructors, and enrollments. The system offers comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for all entities while ensuring robust data validation, user-friendly navigation, and secure database interaction. Built using the MVC pattern, SCMS ensures scalability, maintainability, and seamless user experience.

## Functionalities

- Track instructors' course load and student interactions.
- Display instructors with the highest number of students.
- Identify instructors without assigned courses.

### Course Management
- Create new courses and assign instructors.
- Update course information.
- Remove courses from the system.
- Calculate the average number of students per course.
- Identify courses with low student enrollment.

### Enrollment Management
- Enroll students in courses.
- Track enrollment across different semesters.
- Update student grades.
- Filter enrollments by criteria such as student, course, semester, or year.
